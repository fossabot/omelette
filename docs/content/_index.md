## :bookmark_tabs: Description

In the Java platform, we usually run the unit tests through some build tool, such as [Maven](https://maven.apache.org), [Gradle](https://gradle.org), and so on.
However, it is hard to run the unit tests on the CLI environment.

Calculating test coverages is also complicated for novice programmers.
Since, it requires understanding how to use several libraries (unit test library, coverage measuring library, and the build tool).

Running the unit tests and calculating test coverages usually requires software projects.
It is generally tiresome for calculating test coverages of toy programs with their unit tests.

Therefore, we developed `omelette` for running unit tests and calculating test coverages in the CLI environment for the Java platform.
